# Introduction

BDHM (Brownian particle Dynamics with Hydrodynamics and Magnetic forces) combines magnetic dipole interactions and hydrodynamic interactions on the point particle level with a heuristic repulsion model for the spatial expansion of the colloids to imitate the dynamics of the experiments described in 

[1] Scalable high-throughput microfluidic separation of magnetic microparticles by Hongti Gu et al.

Reproducing the qualitative behavior of the experiments in Ref.1 with the heavily simplified toy model implemented in BDHM, we can show the generality of the underlying dynamic phenomena. All information and methods employed by BDHM are described in detail in the supporting information of Ref.1. While BDHM can be used to repeat the corresponding simulations, we strongly encourage full reproduction using the information in said supporting information.

# What BDHM is and what it is not

BDHM is a heavily simplified toy model that trades physical rigorously for straightforward concepts to act as a proof of concept for the experiments and the suggested system of Ref.1. It successfully reproduces the dynamic behavior of the experiments qualitatively and, thus, shows that the found results are independent of the concrete realization of the system. However, BDHM does not generate precise quantitative results and the corresponding simulation results should be interpreted qualitatively. Nevertheless, compared to the resolution of the experiments, BDHM can be used to get an idea of the behavior of the system on the particle level.
